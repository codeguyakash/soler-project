      question: "What is a Grid Connected Rooftop Solar PV System?",
      answer:
        "In grid connected rooftop small Solar Photo Voltaic (SPV) system, the DC (Direct Current) power generated from solar panel is converted to AC (Alternating Current) power using power conditioning unit/Inverter and is fed to the grid. Conversion to AC is desirable as AC is the most commonly used and most preferred electric power for household equipment, office, and buildings, etc. The major use of DC is to supply power to electrical devices and also to charge batteries.",

    {
      id: 14,
      question: "What is net-metering?",
      answer:
        "All SPV systems generate power only during daytime when sun is available. In net-metered systems, the generated power is utilized for self-consumption, and excess power is exported to the grid as long as grid is available. In case, where solar power is not sufficient due to cloud cover etc., power is drawn from the grid to power the loads. A bi-directional or net meter records the energy flow in both the directions and at the end of billing period net energy used is calculated. The beneficiary has to pay for only the net energy used.",
    },
    {
      id: 15,
      question: "What is net-billing?",
      answer:
        "Connections in net-billing RTS are similar to net-metering. However, at the end of the billing cycle (normally a month) any excess energy in the grid shall not be carried forward like in net metering, but shall be purchased by the DISCOM as per pre-decided tariff. Therefore, energy banking in the grid is only within a billing cycle.",
